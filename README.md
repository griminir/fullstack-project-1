<h2 align="left">Why did I make the choices I made</h2>

###

<p align="left"><strong><u>Frontend:</u></strong><br><br>React: I decided on react because it's used a lot in the industry, and as an new and up-and-coming developer it had a lot of documentation and a massive community to help if I needed it.<br><br>Typescipt: I chose to use typescript for the fact that a lot of the industry uses typescript and it helps with uniformity over a bigger project and I just wanted to learn it.<br><br>Chakra-UI: Used as a way to minimize  the CSS needed to be written as it contains React Components that have some basic styling to them.<br><br>Tanstack/react-query: Use as a light weight and more beginner friendly option to Redux, used for fetching and handling the data send to the API.<br><br>Axios: Used for the ease of it compared to using standard fetch.<br><br><strong><u>Backend:</u></strong><br><br>Node.js: As I was new to react it seemed easiest to use a backend that used JavaScript when building the backend for the app and I had some familiarity with node.js from earlier.<br><br>Express: Was the fastest way to set up a server and I had had already dabbled with it before<br><br>Mssql: I was the first one I found that served the purpose of connecting to my database.<br><br>Why did you not do X:<br><br>this is meant to be a minimal viable product that I could show of to let's say a client. So it has the basic functionality to make it work for that.<br>As for most other question I had learned or practiced it before where or I did not know about X until later<br><br>Why is the backend in JavaScript and the Frontend in Typescript: <br><br>I decided on learning typescript after a lot of the backend was already completed and I wanted to see how typescript would mesh with plain javaScript as a way to somewhat use "different" programming languages.</p>
